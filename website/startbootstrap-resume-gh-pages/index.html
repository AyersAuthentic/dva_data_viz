       <p>
           Roughly three weeks into January, 2020 the first reported cases of COVID-19 were documented in United States <sup>[7][11]</sup>. COVID-19 has since cascaded across the US and the rest of the world, with the WHO announcing a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 <sup>[11]</sup>. Shortly after, government officials across the country to initiate mandated stay-at-homeorders <sup>[9]</sup>, which effectively limited population movement across much of the US <sup>[9]</sup>. In this initial stage of the pandemic, <b>remote workers were three times less likely to lose their job</b> compared to those without the ability to work remotely <sup>[1]</sup>. <br /><br />Additionally, COVID-19 has been found to increase labor
           market inequality and multiple industries have seen unique and different labor impacts in terms of remote work due to COVID-19 <sup>[2][4][5][17]</sup>. This inequality has brought a significant risk to workers, as even though <b>97% of employees recommend to others the benefits of remote work and wish to continue to work remotely</b> <sup>[15]</sup>, COVID-19 related job displacement has typically been unrelated to work performance, but has been related to the ability to work remotely <sup>[6]</sup>. These challenges make it more critical than ever to understand what employment data is telling us, so resources can be made available to meet the changing scope of work post-COVID.
